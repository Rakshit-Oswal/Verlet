This project makes use of verlet integration to simulate a cloth. Segments of the cloth can be severed by clicking on the intersecting points. Depending on the "tension" the cloth is under, parts of it change colour based on that to depict the "stretch"

It contains one other js file that has a few particles affected by a downward acceleration and in some constraint relation with one another. The simulation on pressing 'S' depicts their motion.
